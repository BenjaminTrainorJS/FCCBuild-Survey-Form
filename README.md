This is the second Front-end Project from freecodecamp.org from their 'Responsive Web Design Certification'

I have focused on the HTML to ensure that the survey functions properly. 

There is minimal CSS on this file to look practical but nothing comprehensive. It somewaht resembles the example page, see: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP 

I will appreciate any feedback or suggestions about the HTML side of things, I'm not too fussed about the look of it as I'm not a Graphic Designer.
